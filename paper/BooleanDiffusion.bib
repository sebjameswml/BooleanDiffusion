	abstract = {Turing’s pattern formation mechanism exhibits sensitivity to the details of the initial conditions suggesting that, in isolation, it cannot robustly generate pattern within noisy biological environments. Nonetheless, secondary aspects of developmental self-organisation, such as a growing domain, have been shown to ameliorate this aberrant model behaviour. Furthermore, while in-situ hybridisation reveals the presence of gene expression in developmental processes, the influence of such dynamics on Turing’s model has received limited attention. Here, we novelly focus on the Gierer–Meinhardt reaction diffusion system considering delays due the time taken for gene expression, while incorporating a number of different domain growth profiles to further explore the influence and interplay of domain growth and gene expression on Turing’s mechanism. We find extensive pathological model behaviour, exhibiting one or more of the following: temporal oscillations with no spatial structure, a failure of the Turing instability and an extreme sensitivity to the initial conditions, the growth profile and the duration of gene expression. This deviant behaviour is even more severe than observed in previous studies of Schnakenberg kinetics on exponentially growing domains in the presence of gene expression (Gaffney and Monk in Bull. Math. Biol. 68:99–130, 2006). Our results emphasise that gene expression dynamics induce unrealistic behaviour in Turing’s model for multiple choices of kinetics and thus such aberrant modelling predictions are likely to be generic. They also highlight that domain growth can no longer ameliorate the excessive sensitivity of Turing’s mechanism in the presence of gene expression time delays. The above, extensive, pathologies suggest that, in the presence of gene expression, Turing’s mechanism would generally require a novel and extensive secondary mechanism to control reaction diffusion patterning.},

	abstract = {The incorporation of time delays can greatly affect the behaviour of partial differential equations and dynamical systems. In addition, there is evidence that time delays in gene expression due to transcription and translation play an important role in the dynamics of cellular systems. In this paper, we investigate the effects of incorporating gene expression time delays into a one-dimensional putative reaction diffusion pattern formation mechanism on both stationary domains and domains with spatially uniform exponential growth. While oscillatory behaviour is rare, we find that the time taken to initiate and stabilise patterns increases dramatically as the time delay is increased. In addition, we observe that on rapidly growing domains the time delay can induce a failure of the Turing instability which cannot be predicted by a naive linear analysis of the underlying equations about the homogeneous steady state. The dramatic lag in the induction of patterning, or even its complete absence on occasions, highlights the importance of considering explicit gene expression time delays in models for cellular reaction diffusion patterning.},

	abstract = {Developmental dynamics in Boolean models of gene networks self-organize, either into point attractors (stable repeating patterns of gene expression) or limit cycles (stable repeating sequences of patterns), depending on the network interactions specified by a genome of evolvable bits. Genome specifications for dynamics that can map specific gene expression patterns in early development onto specific point attractor patterns in later development are essentially impossible to discover by chance mutation alone, even for small networks. We show that selection for approximate mappings, dynamically maintained in the states comprising limit cycles, can accelerate evolution by at least an order of magnitude. These results suggest that self-organizing dynamics that occur within lifetimes can, in principle, guide natural selection across lifetimes.},

	abstract = {Feedback inhibition of gene expression is a widespread phenomenon in which the expression of a gene is downregulated by its protein product. Feedback in eukaryotic cells involves time delays resulting from transcription, transcript splicing and processing, and protein synthesis. In principle, such delays can result in oscillatory mRNA and protein expression [1]. However, experimental evidence of such delay-driven oscillations has been lacking. Using mathematical modeling informed by recent data, I show that the observed oscillatory expression and activity of three proteins is most likely to be driven by transcriptional delays. Each protein (Hes1, p53, and NF-κB) is a component of a short feedback inhibition loop 2, 3, 4. The oscillatory period is determined by the delay and the protein and mRNA half-lives, but it is robust to changes in the rates of transcription and protein synthesis. In contrast to nondelayed models, delayed models do not require additional components in the feedback loop. These results provide direct evidence that transcriptional delays can drive oscillatory gene activity and highlight the importance of considering delays when analyzing genetic regulatory networks, particularly in processes such as developmental pattern formation, where short half-lives and feedback inhibition are common.},

	abstract = {The issue of how to incorporate time-delays into a mathematical model in which individuals are moving around requires careful consideration. Any time-delay term must also involve a weighted spatial averaging to account for movement of individuals during the time-delay period. Most of the current literature on this subject is on reaction–diffusion equations and concentrates on the simplest case when the spatial domain is infinite. In this paper we consider what changes arise when the domain is finite. Spatial averaging kernels are computed explicitly for the case of a finite, one-dimensional domain. To illustrate the ideas we concentrate on a diffusive nutrient-plankton model. The model is analysed in terms of the local stability of the steady states and bifurcations. The results of some numerical simulations are also presented.},
